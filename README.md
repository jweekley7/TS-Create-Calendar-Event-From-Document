# TS-Create-Calendar-Event-From-Document
One of my companies uses Google Docs for recording meeting minutes. I created an add-on for scheduling the next meeting right from the current document. The add-on will create the document for the next meeting and attach the current document as well as the next to the calendar event. It will also create a Google Meet link if selected.
